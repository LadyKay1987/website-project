<h1> Oh hai!</h1>
<p>This is a project for CodeFirst Girls that involves developing a custom website from scratch.</p>

<p>The idea we have selected is for a dog-walkers group hosted by local dog shelters; here, members will be able to make an account, either volunteer to walk the shelter dogs or arrange to join on walks with their own dogs. The website would promote the group as being not only beneficial to the health and wellbeing of those talking part in the walks, but also to the dogs within the shelter. These activities would allow the dogs to not only become more confident around new people, but with other dogs as well. The shelter would also have the dogs available for adoption, thus allowing for those interested in adopting a dog the chance to bond.</p>
